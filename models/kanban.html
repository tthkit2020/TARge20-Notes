                &#10133; Kanban is a very simple and easy to understand system that makes it practical for the management of a company to apply this system effectively.

            <td>
                &#10134; Kanban cannot be used as an independent tool. It is not a methodology that could be applied solely rather it can be merged with other processes and systems of a company like JIT, make to order and scrum etc. making these systems more visible.
